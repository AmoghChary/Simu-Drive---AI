 SimuDrive-AI 🚗🧠

SimuDrive-AI is a Python-based self-driving car simulation project. It integrates multiple computer vision modules including object detection using YOLOv5, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition using deep learning. This project is built as a part of a research initiative and is modular, allowing easy expansion and testing.
